# go-homebrew-apps-installer
This small script installs a list of my favorite homebrew packages at once after formatting your MacOS device.  
You can add or remove casks/formulas from the list to suit your needs using flags or dialog menu through the terminal.

Instructions, Usage and Examples will be added soon.

# USAGE THROUGH TERMINAL DIALOGUE

2. Run the app by double clicking on it or through the terminal using the following command in the directory where the app is located:  ```./ogi-app```  
3. Follow the instructions on the terminal. Refer to the *Flags* section for more details on the usage with flags.
