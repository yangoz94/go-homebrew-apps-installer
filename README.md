# go-homebrew-apps-installer
This small installs a list of my favorite homebrew packages at once after formatting your MacOS device.  
You can add or remove casks/formulas from the list to suit your needs using flags or dialog menu through the terminal.

Instructions, Usage and Examples will be added soon.

 See the list of packages in the config/config.go file.
